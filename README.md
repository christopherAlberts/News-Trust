News Trust: Identifying trustworthy news with NLP


## NLP-based Fake News Detection and Sentiment Analysis in News Articles

# Introduction

This Final project will aim to build a fake news classifier with a difference. Instead of just indicating whether a news article is fake or not, it will also aim to do the following:

> News Percentage Accuracy Detection – More than just standard fake news detection, will also show the percentage accuracy.
> 
> Text classification – Will assign categories to each news article based on its content.
> 
> Sentiment Analysis – Will be done on each article to determine the emotional tone behind each piece of given text
